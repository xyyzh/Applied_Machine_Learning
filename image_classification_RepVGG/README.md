Hello dear prof or TA!

Our code for reproducing the results is available here: https://github.com/xyyzh/RepVGG. We have also provided them (named as RepVGG-main.zip) in our submitted zip file.

To replicate our results, you can simply run the cells in the .ipynb files since it clones the git hub repo. 

Merry Christmas in advance! <3
